Quench your community thirst with new announcements from Discord!

Hey HypeSquaders,

We’re going to keep this intro brief as we have some cool news to share. You might have noticed some new stuff dropping this week, so grab a drink and settle in!

In case you missed the news https://discord.com/blog/xbox-voice-integration-announcement, Discord Voice is coming to Xbox!

Now you’ll be able to connect to Discord Voice chats directly from your Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One consoles and talk directly with your friends on Discord.

Sometimes, cross-play between your Xbox PC friends happens. We want to make sure you have the opportunity to talk while exploring new biomes with your friends in Minecraft or planning a few rounds of Big Team Battle in Halo Infinite.

Discord started as a way to bring people together around games, no matter what platform they use. Voice on Xbox has been something that Discord users around the world have been asking for, and we’re stoked to bring it to everyone with the help of our friends at Xbox.

Want to learn how to set it up? Check out our blog http://dis.gd/xbox-voice for detailed instructions.

For our next order of business, starting today, we’re excited to begin rolling out a new type of channel called Forum Channels to servers on Discord.

Forum Channels are a new space where you can have more focused conversations within a server. If there’s a specific topic you’d like to discuss, you can make a forum for it, and then all of the discussion can happen right there.

Think of Forum Channels as a place for focused discussion rather than a single ongoing chat channel.

Not sure where to start with Forums? Here are examples of ways you can use them:

For running gaming servers, Forums are great for specific gaming tips or DnD world lore-building.
	If you run your own gaming community, you can create support channels on what PC parts best fit in a Micro-Case, troubleshooting “help why blue screen”, and other tips & tricks!
	If you like ARGs, or Alternate Reality Games, you could create a Forum to help solve specific riddles, puzzles, and more!

Ready to make your own Forum channel? Head over to our Help Center article https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6208479917079-Forum-Channels-FAQ to learn how to create your own.

Well, HypeSquadders, that’s all (for now).

Now that the summer heat is behind us, stay tuned for some bone-chilling updates next month!

Until next time,
