Back-to-school announcements & new merch announcements inbound.

Hey HypeSquaders,

Hope you’re keeping cool at the end of the summer months. We know many of you are heading back to school (or you might have already started - if so, good luck!), so we’re here to share some ways that we’re here to help you out.

Grab your favorite drink and settle in…

Last year, Discord launched Student Hubs, which help you discover student-run servers for just your school. Whether you’re going to campus every day or learning from home, there are always things going on that you might want to be part of but don’t know how to find.

With Student Hubs, you can…

Meet your classmates - Find and talk with your classmates on the member list - like a yearbook!

Find new communities - Browse the server categories or use the search bar to find servers relevant to your interests - clubs and communities galore!

Share your server - Add your server to a Student Hub so classmates with similar interests can join - make more friends!

Stay connected - Always stay up to date and take part in campus groups and activities.

Sound interesting? Need more info? We have a handy guide https://discord.com/student-hubs to help you out.

Here’s one more note to add to your school schedule... new merch is here! Our latest designs have our student friends in mind — we want to make sure you are feeling fresh & motivated in this new semester. Enter: the Daydream Doodle Collection https://bit.ly/3AlfW7f.

With its sketchy skateboards, thought bubbles, and jetpacks, Discord’s newest merch collection represents those little moments where your troubles fall away and your imagination takes flight. Find your latest motivation with new pencils, notebooks, seasonal shirts, stylish hats, and a Discord First: Smartphone and AirPods Pro Cases.

Here’s another drop we’re excited about… The Wumpus keycap! This has been lovingly engineered by artisanal keycrafter Tiny https://www.tinymakesthings.com/ and made by our partner Kono https://kono.store/. 

Find whichever spot on your keyboard that would be most improved by that boopable snoot: “W” for Wumpus? “A” for Adorable? “Num Lock” for secret reasons? Your Wumpus, your call.

This collection is available while supplies last, so save the procrastination for later and order now https://bit.ly/3AlfW7f.

We have more fun things to share with you soon™, so keep your eyes peeled during the fall season!

Catch you on the flip slide,
