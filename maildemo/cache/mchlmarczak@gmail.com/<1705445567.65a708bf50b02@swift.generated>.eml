We are reaching out to you to let you know that we’re updating our User Agreement, Code of Conduct, and some other terms that govern our relationship with you. The new terms will apply from February 17th, 2024. Please read below to learn what changes exactly are we introducing. If you are unsubscribed from marketing emails – please mind that this is not one of those. We’re just obliged by law to inform every GOG user of the changes to our terms. Why? It’s been some time since we last updated our terms of service. GOG is evolving and so are our surroundings, like technology and legal regulations we need to mind. And so, we figured the time has come to present to you the updated versions of the rules that govern GOG’s relationship with you. The changes we made are mostly aimed at boosting online safety and transparency on moderation of content posted on GOG services. What did we change? Here’s a summary of the main changes: • We’ve made some changes to our User Agreement to better inform you about other terms (like GOG Code of Conduct) that apply to your use of GOG services, as well as updated general information on content moderation and complaints procedure, • We’ve described how our recommendation systems work and where we use them (so you know why you see what you see when browsing GOG), • We’ve updated our Forum Code of Conduct and extended it to all user actions in GOG services (which is why it’s called GOG Code of Conduct now). It governs the rules for our Community, such as what cannot be posted on GOG and what happens when someone breaks these rules, • We’ve set up new Infringing Content and Copyright Policy that regulates how we deal with keeping illegal or otherwise infringing content off of GOG, and how you can report content to our moderators (in addition to our existing Copyright Policy, which discussed only reporting copyright infringements), • We’ve added information on single points of contact for users and authorities, and added some other legally required disclosures to our terms. Plus, we did some minor tidying up of the documents. You can see the updated documents here: • User Agreement • GOG Code of Conduct • Infringing Content and Copyright Policy • Recommendation systems on GOG Do I need to take any action? No, no action is required on your end. If you continue to use GOG services after February 17th, you are agreeing to these updates. What if I have questions? Please contact us HERE and we’ll be happy to help. Warm regards, GOG Team GOG.COM © 2024. Part of CD PROJEKT group. All other trademarks and copyrights are properties of their respective owners.
