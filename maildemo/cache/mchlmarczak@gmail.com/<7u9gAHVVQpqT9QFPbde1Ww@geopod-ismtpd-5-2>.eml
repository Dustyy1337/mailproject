A Winter Welcome To You, HypeSquad!

This time of year is about coming together, spending time with the people who matter to you, and doing the things that bring you joy. We want to celebrate with you and the community you’ve found on Discord with one of our favorite celebrations, Snowsgiving.

If you haven’t heard of Snowsgiving before, it’s the time of year where the entire Discord community is brought together through the power of the holidays. It’s quite a magical time!

Let’s see what Snowsgiving has in store for us this year, shall we?

Mental Health support continues to be a focus for us here at Discord. Earlier this year, we announced a partnership with Crisis Text Line, a nonprofit that provides 24/7 text-based mental health support and crisis intervention via trained volunteer Crisis Counselors.

For Snowsgiving 2022, we are happy to share that we will be continuing our partnership with Crisis Text Line.

There will be fabulous, unique Discord Merchandise https://bit.ly/3hHOxqk available to purchase, with all profits from Snowsgiving merch going directly to support Crisis Text Line!

Let’s talk more about that merch next.

Another Snowsgiving tradition of ours is exclusive Discord Snowsgiving merch! This year we have some truly magnificent merch that is sure to give you the coziest of vibes—from a matching hoodie and mug, to cozy socks, postcards, and the most chill air freshener.

Check out the Discord merch store https://bit.ly/3hHOxqk to see the entire new Snowsgiving merch collection, including a newly coveted keyboard and mouse pad.

And if you can’t decide - we’ve put together some merch bundles, so you can take home a nice collection of this year’s Snowsgiving warm fuzzies. All Discord profits from our Snowsgiving merch will go toward supporting Crisis Text Line.

Starting today, once you open up Discord on your desktop, you’ll see an in-app Snowsgiving page that will direct to you to everything you need for Snowsgiving festivities. Our landing page has snowy surprises https://discord.com/snowsgiving you can unlock each day.

Looking for a community to experience Snowsgiving with? The Discord Town Hall Server https://discord.gg/discord-townhall will be hosting a bunch of end-of-year festivities!

Feel free to join us for the wintry fun! From NOW through December 12, we will have various events, and a special place to interact with others who are also taking part in the Snowsgiving festivities.

We can't wait to chat, create, and spend time with you for this year’s Snowsgiving—all in the name of charity.

See you online,
