An Introduction to Asynchronous Programming in Python with Async IO

Writing sequential (or synchronous) code is familiar to many programmers, even when they‚Äôre just getting started. It‚Äôs the kind of code that is executed one line at a time, one instruction at a time.

¬†

In the asynchronous world, the occurrence of events are independent of the main program flow. This means that actions are executed in the background, without waiting for the completion of the previous action.

¬†

In other words, the lines of code are executed concurrently.

¬†

Imagine you have certain independent tasks and each one takes a lot of running time to finish. Their outputs aren‚Äôt dependent on each other. So, you want to start them all at once. If these tasks are executed in a particular order, the program will have to wait for each task to finish before starting the next one. This waiting time is blocking the program.

¬†

Asynchronous programming paradigm helps to execute these tasks concurrently and ensures you can beat that waiting time and use the resources more efficiently.

¬†

Python 3 has a native support for async programming, Async IO, which provides a simple way to execute concurrent tasks.

One of the biggest differences between GPT-4 and its predecessors is that it can process both text and images, allowing it to analyze the contents of an image and connect that information with a written question. OpenAI claims that GPT-4 is better at creative tasks and problem-solving, but it also tends to ‚Äúhallucinate‚Äù information and be confidently wrong in its predictions.¬†

SOAP is a web protocol that can be challenging for developers, but it's still widely used because many legacy web services were implemented using it. The tutorial covers how to obtain the SOAP web service address, review supported operations, test SOAP requests using Postman, and create a remote class to make remote calls to the API service.

You are given an integer N. Your job is to figure out how many substrings inside of N divide evenly with N.

Confused? I'll break it down for you.

Let's say that you are given the integer '877692'.

8 does not evenly divide with 877692. 877692/8 = 109711 with 4 remainder. 7 does not evenly divide with 877692. 877692/7 = 125384 with 4 remainder. 7 does not evenly divide with 877692. 877692/7 = 125384 with 4 remainder. 6 evenly divides with 877692. 877692/6 = 146282 with 0 remainder. 9 does not evenly divide with 877692. 877692/9 = 97521 with 3 remainder. 2 evenly divides with 877692. 877692/2 = 438846 with 0 remainder.We aren't going to stop there though. We need to check ALL of the substrings inside of 877692.

87 does not evenly divide with 877692. 877692/87 = 10088 with 36 remainder. 77 does not evenly divide with 877692. 877692/77 = 11398 with 46 remainder. 76 does not evenly divide with 877692. 877692/76 = 11548 with 44 remainder. 69 does not evenly divide with 877692. 877692/69 = 12720 with 12 remainder. etc.
