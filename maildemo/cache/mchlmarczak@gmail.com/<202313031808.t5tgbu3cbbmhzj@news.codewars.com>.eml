How To Incorporate Coding Practice into a Daily Routine

The alarm goes off and maybe you hit snooze or maybe you spring out of bed ready for the day. Either way, once you're awake, a routine kicks into gear. Stumble into the kitchen, make coffee, feed the pet, brush your teeth, check email, etc. Basic tasks like these are like switching on autopilot.

Â 

Routines are unique to each person: A rigid checklist that demands completion or else the day is lost. A ritualistic pattern that brings the comfort of familiarity. A nearly impossible concept that erratically changes from day to day. A customizable tool that helps achieve personal and professional goals. They look and feel different for everyone.

Â 

Routines are proven to benefit nearly every part of life, even if your routine isn't identical day after day. I could go on and on about the mental, emotional, and health betterments that routines offer, but that's not today's point. As a coder, consistent routines are your strongest asset.

Â 

This is old news, but you've chosen a career that requires a commitment to lifelong study. The best way to stay sharp and keep learning is to make coding a daily habit. If you struggle to form new habits or get routines to stick, here are 6 tips to keep you on track.

###[Find out whether the shape is a cube](https://www.codewars.com/kata/58d248c7012397a81800005c?utm_source=newsletter)

To find the volume (centimeters cubed) of a cuboid you use the formula:

volume = Length * Width * Height

But someone forgot to use proper record keeping, so we only have the volume, and the length of a single side!

It's up to you to find out whether the cuboid has equal sides (= is a cube).

Return true if the cuboid could have equal sides, return false otherwise.

Return false for invalid numbers too (e.g volume or side is less than or equal to 0).

Note: side will be an integer

###[The Bee](https://www.codewars.com/kata/6408ba54babb196a61d66a65?utm_source=newsletter)

Imagine a honeycomb - a field of hexagonal cells with side N. There is a bee in the top left cell A. In one move it can crawl one cell down, one cell down-right or one cell up-right (the bee does not crawl up or left).

Write a function that outputs the number of ways the bee can crawl from cell A to the opposite cell B.

**Input data:**

*The function receives a single number N - the size of the hexagonal field 2 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 200.*

**Output data:**

*The function should output a single integer - the number of ways.*

**Example:**

the_bee(2) --> 11 the_bee(3) --> 291 the_bee(5) --> 259123**Code length limit:**

*To prevent hardcoding, your code cannot exceed 1 000 characters.*
