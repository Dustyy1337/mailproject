Hi @Dustyy1337,

We noticed your personal access token (classic) "fesgbt" with repo scope will expire in about 19 hours.

If this token is still needed, visit https://github.com/settings/tokens/1516576859/regenerate to generate an equivalent.

If you run into problems, please contact support by visiting https://github.com/contact?tags=dotcom-accounts

Thanks,
