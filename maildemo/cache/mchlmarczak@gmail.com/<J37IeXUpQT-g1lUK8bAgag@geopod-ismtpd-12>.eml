Celebrate Discord’s 8th Birthday with us with free Activities through June 15 & MORE!

Hey HypeSquad,

Can you believe it?! Discord is now EIGHT YEARS OLD! (WOW)

It’s been a wonderful eight years. Every day, we get to build a place where close friends come together, relationships are built, and just saying “hi” can lead to a lifetime of memories.

To celebrate, between May 15–June 15, ALL ACTIVITIES ARE FREE (for those who don’t know - Activities https://discord.com/blog/server-activities-games-voice-watch-together are a way to play games & watch together on Discord). Because what’s better than celebrating by playing games with your friends over Discord?

Oh, and in case you missed this news, Activities are also available in voice calls in all DMs and Group DMs. So now you can bring the party into your DMs with friends, too!

But the party’s not the same without you. Join us in our Discord Town Hall http://discord.gg/discord-townhall server, where we’ll be hosting a wide array of events and surprises for the next thirty days, including special Activity Game Nights featuring Discord Staff and special guests, an Activities Tournament, and running community events throughout the month.

We may even have some surprises in store… but ya gotta swing by the Town Hall https://www.notion.so/2022-Discord-Strategy-42a3a35c8d224115b63b6e71860e8e16 server to be in the know. We’ll be waitin’ for ya. 💖

Nitro members also get some special perks to join in on the birthday fun!

During our birthday season, Nitro https://discord.com/nitro members can join the party in style with a new set of Avatar Decorations. Head to User Settings > Profiles on either desktop or mobile and choose from a selection of snazzy new decorations, such as headphones, space-ready helmets, and a HUD interface to make yourself look like you’re piloting a mech.

Birthday parties also aren’t complete without gifting something to the friends you care about. That’s why, Nitro members can share a two-week trial of Discord Nitro with up to three of their soon-to-be-lucky friends!

If one of your friends is eligible for a Nitro trial, you’ll see a new Nitro-shaped button when you go to talk to them in DMs. Select that, and you can offer them one of your three free trials.

All of these Nitro birthday perks are available until June 15.

Last but not least…did we mention, birthday merch?! Oh yeah, we got birthday merch.

Cybernetic vibes, futuristic feels, and mecha moods encapsulate our latest merch line: the DISXCORE Collection. Alongside the usual shirts, hoodies, pins, and water bottles are a new DISXCORE sling bag, a snazzy button-down shirt, and a Bumper Sticker.

Plus, complete your desk setup with a set of Wumpus-themed Wave:3 Microphone and Stream Deck from our friends at Elgato. Have Wumpus bring your crisp, clear voice to your friends as if you were in the same room as them.

The DISXCORE line drops Wednesday, May 17 at 10am PDT. In the meantime, check out everything the Discord Merch Store https://discordmerch.com/dxccn has to offer and bookmark the store for when DISXCORE drops.

We have so much to celebrate, and it’s all because of you. These last eight years wouldn’t have been possible without you, so we just wanted to say: thank you. We hope you enjoy all the festivities we’ve planned!

See you online,
