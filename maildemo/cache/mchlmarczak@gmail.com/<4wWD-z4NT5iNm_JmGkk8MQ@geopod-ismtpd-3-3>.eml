Enjoy special birthday weekend features, an animated video background for everyone to use, and new threads to wear under the summer skies. 💜

To The Best Community Ever,

Seven years. Just imagine it: we've been together for seven whole years. Parties, features, friends, and plenty of changes are just a few of the things we have to celebrate.

So we’re taking the celebration of seven awesome years to you. On the party agenda: special birthday weekend features, a special animated video background for everyone to use, and new threads to wear under the summer skies.

Come on — strap a party hat on and follow us!

Grab your rattle rachets and fill up the balloons. We’re starting the party directly on Discord itself with the all-new Party Mode, rolling out now and available until May 16th, 2022. Just refresh your client! 

Enable Party Mode in your User Settings > Party Mode tab. Once you do, every character you type will explode with confetti. Crowds will cheer and your typing field will tremble as your Combo meter increases. Yes, we said Combo meter.
	It's your party, so you can customize (and cry) if you want to. Head into the Party Mode tab to tailor your festive experience. And something about… Achievements?
	Being the party controller means you set the vibe anywhere from “low key” to “borderline unusable,” and there are no wrong answers.
	If you’ve previously enabled Reduced Motion in the Accessibility Settings, Party Mode will default to a very gently festive experience: screen shake and confetti will be turned off unless you disable Reduced Motion.

Party Mode is opt-in, so don’t worry — you won’t get jump-scared by confetti this weekend. Check out more in our Help Center article https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/5706956956695 and party on!

The perfect party isn't complete without mood clothing. Mood clothing? Yes, I'm committing; it's mood clothing.

The Idle Nights collection is a chill mood distilled. Whether you’re spending those golden hours hitting the town or Voice chatting with all your best friends, the Idle Nights line has something for every type of outing (or inning).

We went all out with this one with new hoodies, shirts, stickers, and more. Hit the beach with summer-centric accessories like beach towels, water bottles, and tank tops to bring those blurple vibes to the waves.

Don’t delay — Idle Nights is available now on discordmerch.com https://bit.ly/3vWGoD0!

From confetti and poolside vibes, there’s something for hard-partying and soft-celebrating like...

	Check out our Birthday Bash blog https://discord.com/blog/7th-birthday for more surprises and incredible fan celebrations!
	Share your favorite community story with us on social all weekend long! You also may want to keep a close eye out here...

It’s been a wonderful seven years. Every day, we get to build a place where close friends come together, relationships are built, and just saying “hi” can lead to a lifetime of memories.

We’re so thankful to be a part of your journey. Thank you. 💜
