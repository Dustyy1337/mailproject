We’re introducing new terms on the use of Miro AI features
On July 17, 2024, we’re introducing a new [AI Features Addendum](https://miro.com/legal/ai-features-addendum/) that will supplement the agreement you have with Miro. We’re also updating the [Miro Privacy Policy](https://miro.com/legal/privacy-policy-july-17/). These changes make it easier for you to understand what to expect from Miro as you use our AI features, such as Miro Assist.
You can review the new terms [here](https://miro.com/legal/ai-features-addendum/). At a glance, these updates explain:
•

How Miro uses inputs you provide and output generated by Miro AI
features.
•

Ownership of output generated by Miro’s AI features.
•

Limitations associated with the quickly-evolving technologies
that underpin Miro AI features.
You don't have to do anything to accept these changes. By
continuing to use Miro after July 17th you are agreeing to the
new terms. If you have questions check the FAQ below.
AI Features Addendum FAQ
We don’t train generative AI with your board content. Miro relies
on commercially available models (such as developed by OpenAI) as
well as open-source models that are trained with licensed data
and public domain content where copyright has expired. Miro may
use usage data and other meta data to improve your product
experience and develop features like diagramming and sticky
clustering.
You can choose not to participate in our AI feature improvement
efforts. We currently don’t use your input into and output from
Miro AI features to improve our product. If we intend to change
our training approach, we will inform you upfront.
You own your board content. No license granted to Miro to operate
its services will supersede your ownership rights.
Thank you for using Miro!
