How to work for a global tech company, anytime, anywhere

The remote workplace is becoming increasingly dominant in the technology industry. Technology is enabling remote work, and technologists are benefiting from it. The world of work has changed dramatically over the past two and a half years. Before COVID-19, some companies had embraced a remote-first strategy, but they were the exception rather than the rule. Today, some of the largest companies across the world are embracing remote work as a default business model.

Â 

We sat down with four members of our Andela Community â€“ Hannah Olukoye, Rizwan Jafri, Saheed Badru, and Teri Eyenike â€“ to gain their insights into working for global companies, navigating the remote workplace and the importance of community in growing your career.

Â 


###What was life like before you embraced remote work?
Â 

**Teri**: Before I started working remotely I was working in the wellness industry. I worked in the Gym, and had to be in the office almost the entire day. I wasnâ€™t enjoying the process of going into work everyday and needed something extra to occupy my time; learning new skills and trying to boost myself, to make sure I got a remote opportunity. In 2021, I started working remotely. You donâ€™t have to commute, you can spend time with your family and you have a better work life balance. Your health is guaranteed!

Â 

**Saheed:** I started my career 10 years ago, in the investment banking industry, 100% of the time based in the office. Gradually, in 2015, I transitioned into hybrid work, working three days a week in the office and two days working remotely. It was fair, although the challenge of community in Lagos means you have to leave almost as early as 5am to beat the traffic, getting home at 11pm. It was expensive as well, and I saw communiting as a big distraction. During COVID-19 I became fully remote â€“ joining Andela was my catalyst to going 100% fully remote.

Â 

**Rizwan:** I was working fully on-premises before COVID-19. Working on-premises was good, but since Covid I not only got used to working from home, but I really enjoyed watching my second child grow, learning to crawl and then to walk. And that was an amazing and enjoyable experience for me. It motivated me to look for more remote work â€“ and I found Andela. Now, Iâ€™m working with a global team who live in 14 different time zones, and still weâ€™re able to catch up with each other and deliver the work. Before joining Andela I was working remotely, so the transition to Andela wasnâ€™t difficult. Now I really love this experience. I canâ€™t work on premises again!

Â 

**Hannah:** I was working as a web developer, and the commute on public transport was an hour each way. One week, I arrived extra early and there was a power outage! I had to go home. It became a game of finding out if there was power at the office or not. Thatâ€™s one thing I donâ€™t miss about working on-premises. When Iâ€™m working at home I can decide if I want to work at a shared co-working space or a cafe. Itâ€™s up to me to decide, so Iâ€™m flexible.Â

Looking for a different kind of challenge? Developer assessments powered by Qualifed.io provide the opportunity to practice on challenges used during technical assessments. Test yourself with the [Bash/Linux Quiz](https://www.qualified.io/assess/643349f9f985ee00251f3063) or the [PowerShell Quiz](https://www.qualified.io/assess/64556049d36b3b027187bab1).

###[A Brave New Wordle](https://www.codewars.com/kata/62013b174c72240016600e60?utm_source=newsletter)

Wordle is a game where users try to guess a hidden 5 letter word. Feedback is given for each guess, in the form of colored tiles, indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position.


###The Brief
Make a function that takes in a 5 letter guess and, comparing to a known solution, returns clues for the user to solve the wordle puzzle.


###Requirements

- The function takes in two strings of 5 letters each, a guess and a solution. 
- The function returns a string of 5 letters. 
- The returned string is composed of letters each corresponding to a letter of the guess: 'b' (black) when the letter is not present in the answer; 'y' (yellow) when the letter is present but in a different location; and 'g' (green) when the letter is present and in the right location. 

###Duplicates

- A letter appearing in the correct place is always green, including if it appears elsewhere in the word. 
- A letter can only be green or yellow as many times as it appears in the correct answer. Extra occurences of that letter are marked as 'b'. Below are some examples, see example tests for more: 
- letters are evaluated left to right. 
Guess: xxxxx Answer: yxxxx Expected Output: bgggg Explanation: extra letters marked as 'b' guess: xxxxz answer:aaaax expected output: ybbbb first x marked as 'y', and each one as 'b' after

###[Interactive Dictionary](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57a93f93bb9944516d0000c1?utm_source=newsletter)

In this kata, your job is to create a class Dictionary which you can add words to and their entries. Example:

>>> d = Dictionary() >>> d.newentry('Apple', 'A fruit that grows on trees') >>> print(d.look('Apple')) A fruit that grows on trees >>> print(d.look('Banana')) Can't find entry for Banana>>> Dictionary d = new Dictionary(); >>> d.newEntry("Apple", "A fruit that grows on trees"); >>> System.out.println(d.look("Apple")); A fruit that grows on trees >>> System.out.println(d.look("Banana")); Cant find entry for Banana>>> let d = new Dictionary(); >>> d.newEntry("Apple", "A fruit that grows on trees"); >>> console.log(d.look("Apple")); A fruit that grows on trees >>> console.log(d.look("Banana")); Can't find entry for BananaGood luck and happy coding!
