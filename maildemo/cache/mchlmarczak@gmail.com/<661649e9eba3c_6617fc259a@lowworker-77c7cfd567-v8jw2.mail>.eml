Hey Dustyy1337!

You just added a passkey to your account from your "Chrome on Android" device.

Because you can still authenticate with your password, we recommend also enabling two-factor authentication.

To enable two-factor authentication, visit https://github.com/settings/security

More information about two-factor authentication can be found on GitHub Help at
https://docs.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication

To see this and other security events for your account, visit https://github.com/settings/security-log

If you did not initiate this action or believe your account has been compromised, it is a good idea to review
your active sessions and all passkeys associated with your account or consider enabling two-factor authentication.

Thanks,
The GitHub Team
