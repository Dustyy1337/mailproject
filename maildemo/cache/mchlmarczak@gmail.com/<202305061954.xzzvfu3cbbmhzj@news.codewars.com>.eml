Input : an array of integers.


- 

Output : this array, but sorted in such a way that there are two wings:


- 

the left wing with numbers decreasing,


- 

the right wing with numbers increasing.


- 

the two wings have the same length. If the length of the array is odd the wings are around the bottom, if the length is even the bottom is considered to be part of the right wing.
