###[Get the Middle Character](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56747fd5cb988479af000028?utm_source=newsletter)

You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

#Examples:

The middle character(s) of the word represented as a string.

###[Find Multiples of a Number](https://www.codewars.com/kata/58ca658cc0d6401f2700045f?utm_source=newsletter)

In this simple exercise, you will build a program that takes a value, integer , and returns a list of its multiples up to another value, limit . If limit is a multiple of integer, it should be included as well. There will only ever be positive integers passed into the function, not consisting of 0. The limit will always be higher than the base.

For example, if the parameters passed are (2, 6), the function should return [2, 4, 6] as 2, 4, and 6 are the multiples of 2 up to 6.
