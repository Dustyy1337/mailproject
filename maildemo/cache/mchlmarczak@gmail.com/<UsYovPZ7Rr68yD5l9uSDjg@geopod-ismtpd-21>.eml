See what we’ve been up to with Disability Pride Month, new Activity drops, and more!

Greetings HypeSquad,

We hope you’re having a Fun Day™. We've been busy bees, but we're here to update you on what's been happening here at Discord.

Let’s buzz into the latest, shall we?

July is Disability Pride Month! No matter your participation level, how you navigate Discord, or what device you use to talk with your friends, there’s a place for you here.

We had the pleasure of celebrating this month by highlighting some amazing inclusive communities. Check out our blog https://discord.com/blog/celebrating-disability-pride-month-with-two-inclusive-communities to learn more about these servers from the Discord Admin Community that are exemplary examples of community spaces on Discord that take into consideration everyone on the platform.

Have you seen our latest Activity drop? This month, we've introduced Color Together https://www.fundaygames.dk/discord/color-together-play-guide for everyone to enjoy!

Color Together is a relaxing game where you can color fun and enjoyable paintings with your friends. You choose a painting, and together you fill out sections of a painting number by number until the painting is done. 

While you can play with your friends, you don’t have to wait for them to join you - you can begin the game whenever you want, and start painting.

To play, join a Voice Channel, DM, or Group DM and click the rocket ship icon (on desktop app, browser, or mobile) and select ‘Color Together’ to start the Activity!

Are you a member of Discord Town Hall http://discord.gg/discord-townhall? If not, you should join! We took a short summer break, but now we're back with some exciting new changes.

Next week, we have an event happening with our friends at Capcom. Are you interested in game development? Do you love Street Fighter 6 as much as we do? Join us in a special Q&A as we talk with Capcom Developer Andrew Alfonso about the launch of Street Fighter 6 & get a glimpse of what it’s like to work at Capcom! This special event takes place on July 25, 6pm PT in Town Hall, so mark your calendars (https://canary.discord.com/events/169256939211980800/1127977273107152967!

We’ll also be hosting a Fireside Chat where we share more news & details on the latest happenings here at Discord. Got questions? Want to learn more about these recent updates? Our Town Hall Fireside Chat is the place to learn.

Our Fireside Chats take place every month in Town Hall and we’d love to have you join us! See you next week.

There you have it - that’s the latest! Don't forget to stay hydrated and get some fresh air! We'll see you soon.
