Fun awaits you with Activities, App Directory, and new Nitro Basic!

Ghoulish Greetings to you, HypeSquadders,

We hope that the scariest of seasons has been trick-or-treating you well. Make sure to dress up in your favorite attire and snack on some delicious sweets. If you don’t celebrate Halloween, get some candy anyways — we won’t tell.

We have a few of our own treats to share and you won’t even get any cavities! Let’s dig in.

Picture this: you’re hanging out with your pals in Voice, but you’re looking for a way to expand the fun beyond just chatting. What if you could spin up something to do right directly within Discord to spend better, more FUN quality time with your friends?

Meet Activities https://discord.com/blog/server-activities-games-voice-watch-together: a way to instantly enjoy shared experiences with friends, such as games and media, on Discord itself.

Jump into a Voice channel and click the new Rocket Ship button to start up an Activity, right from the comfort of your own community.

This week, everyone will be able to launch and enjoy these two Activities and others may become available in the future:

Watch Together: Enjoy the same YouTube video at the same time.
	Putt Party: Mini golf, mega drama.

If you’re a Nitro subscriber, you’ll unlock access to additional Activities — anyone in your server can join a Nitro-exclusive Activity if you launch it, whether they have Nitro or not. For a full breakdown of Activities and what you can launch right now, head over to our blog https://discord.com/blog/server-activities-games-voice-watch-together.

Want to enjoy Activities together? We’re hosting some fun events in Discord Town Hall http://discord.gg/discord-town-hall this month, including a special Halloween treat! Be sure to join the community so you don’t miss out on the fun.

Gather 'round, bot fans and soon-to-be fans: we've got some long-awaited news.

Last year, we announced discord.com/blog/discord-bots-and-app-discovery-announcement our desire to enable the discovery of apps and bots directly on Discord, instead of you having endlessly scour the internet manually.

Guess what? We’re rolling that out for everyone! App Directory is a seamless way to connect you to apps and bots right in your community. From productivity and creativity to music and gaming, there are thousands of apps out there that can help customize your server and cater it to your needs.

Get excited! App Directory is coming your way soon — we can’t wait for you all to enjoy it!

We’ve got one final thing to unveil: Introducing the newest addition to our Nitro family, Nitro Basic! (Isn’t that tiny bike-riding Wumpus just the cutest?)

Nitro Basic is the newest, easiest way to start experiencing the best of what Discord has to offer for a fraction of the cost. It includes some of our favorite perks, such as the ability to use custom emoji or stickers anywhere, bigger file uploads, and more.

The new plan is already available in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand with more availability coming in the next few months.

For all the updates on Nitro and Nitro Basic, head over to our blog https://discord.com/blog/introducing-discord-nitro-basic.

That’s all for now! See you next time for more bone-chilling updates.

Until next time,
