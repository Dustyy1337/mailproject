Hello Codewarrior,

We've been thinking about motivation recently; in an age of
instant gratification and AI cheat codes, how do stay motivated
to improve ourselves?

Our recent census showed that 67.04% of you use Codewars to
inspire you to continue practicing your chosen programming
languages. Whether it is ensuring you keep your streak 
( https://clicks.codewars.com/f/a/k8JMUT-0TLfGBVQVipt4Mw~~/AAQRxQA~/RgRoDMbVP0QgaHR0cDovL2NvZGV3YXJzLmNvbS9zdWJzY3JpcHRpb25XA3NwY0IKZifVQSpm5SlYUlIVbWNobG1hcmN6YWtAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAAL9 ) or working to achieve a higher
rank, we'd love to learn more about your goals. Please share with
us in the motivations 
( https://clicks.codewars.com/f/a/zB1t6xckRdXzeADNqBbHYg~~/AAQRxQA~/RgRoDMbVP0RDaHR0cHM6Ly9kaXNjb3JkLmNvbS9jaGFubmVscy84NDY2MjQ0MjQxOTkwNjE1MjQvMTIzMTk1OTI0NDM1ODU0OTUwNFcDc3BjQgpmJ9VBKmblKVhSUhVtY2hsbWFyY3pha0BnbWFpbC5jb21YBAAAAv0~ )
 topic on Discord.

We strive to offer you gamification techniques across Codewars to
help you set goals, track your progress, and reward your
achievements. But what if you need a little more help
accelerating your ambition to make coding fun, engaging, and
rewarding and improve your skills and confidence along the way?

Here are a few of our recommendations:

Maintain your momentum!

When embarking on a new goal, it's crucial to integrate it into
your daily or weekly routines to ensure success. One effective
strategy is the 'Don't Break the Chain' method. Challenge
yourself to tackle at least one Kata daily, tracking your
progress with tools like Notion or Conjure ( https://clicks.codewars.com/f/a/WTEdpIzg7oJYnmkUqs73GQ~~/AAQRxQA~/RgRoDMbVP0QTaHR0cHM6Ly9jb25qdXJlLnNvL1cDc3BjQgpmJ9VBKmblKVhSUhVtY2hsbWFyY3pha0BnbWFpbC5jb21YBAAAAv0~ ) .

Explore passion projects

While mastering algorithms and staying ahead of industry trends
are vital, indulging in passion projects is equally important.
Allocate weekly dedicated time to pursue those exciting ideas
scribbled on sticky notes.

Prioritize rest

In our quest for productivity, it's easy to overlook the
importance of rest. Taking breaks is essential for maintaining
motivation over extended periods, especially during intense
debugging sessions. Consider incorporating mindfulness practices
into your breaks with apps like Headspace or Calm to rejuvenate
and refocus your mind.

Seek feedback

Feedback is essential for growth as a software engineer. Actively
seek feedback from peers, mentors, or online communities to
identify areas for improvement and celebrate your progress.

Kick start your motivation with a new challenge!

Next week we are launching the first EPIC Challenge on Codewars!
This challenge will connect Codewars, Andela, and Andela's
Learning Communities to celebrate Andela’s 10th anniversary. Keep
your eyes peeled for details on our blog
