You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.

Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.

For example, when the input is green, output should be yellow.

###[Is n divisible by x and y?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5545f109004975ea66000086?utm_source=newsletter)

Create a function that checks if a number n is divisible by two numbers x **AND** y. All inputs are positive, non-zero numbers.

Examples: 1) n = 3, x = 1, y = 3 => true because 3 is divisible by 1 and 3 2) n = 12, x = 2, y = 6 => true because 12 is divisible by 2 and 6 3) n = 100, x = 5, y = 3 => false because 100 is not divisible by 3 4) n = 12, x = 7, y = 5 => false because 12 is neither divisible by 7 nor 5
