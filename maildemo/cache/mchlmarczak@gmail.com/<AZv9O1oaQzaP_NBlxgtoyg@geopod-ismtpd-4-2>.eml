No need for bug sprayâ€”stop by booth #16031 for fresh looks, games, and fun!

Hey There, HypeSquad!

The show floor is opening soon and weâ€™ve saved you a seat at the booth! Weâ€™re proud to partner with DOTEMU to play a little Streets of Revenge 4, Windjammers 2, and TMNT 2: Shredderâ€™s Revenge, so bring a pal and get ready to throw down.

We also have an update on some of our merch items available at the booth. Due to shipping complications caused by regional COVID lockdowns, we wonâ€™t have the following items at PAX East.

Nitro Exclusive Pin
	Wumpus Pin
	Discord Lanyard

While this is disappointing news, we will have both the Wumpus pin and lanyard on our merch store to purchase in a couple of weeks. Stay tuned for more information!

If you just can't wait for a Nitro pin, stop by the booth and talk to a friendly Booth Human in our Nitro line for more information on how to get yours. Limited quantities will be available to ship at 400 pins per day, so stop by early!

Rest assured, weâ€™ll also have a small selection currently available on our site https://discordmerch.com/ at 10:00 AM ET (Eastern Time). While we had previously stated this selection would be available on the PAX site, weâ€™re proud to offer this limited collectionÂ on Discord's store https://discordmerch.com/ instead. Get it while supplies last!

If you're headed to Boston, we can't wait to see you for the first day of camp.Â ðŸ’œ

See You Soon,
