Learn in Public: The community-based learning strategy that improves programming skills

Shawn Wang, better known as swyx, is a Dev Ex leader who worked for companies like Netlify, AWS, and Temporal. Currently, he’s Head of Dev Ex at Airbyte and curates the DX Tips newsletter, focusing on developer tools, developer relations, and all things developer experience. He’s also a proud Learn in Public Evangelist.

 

While swyx is not the founder of LIP (the idea of community based learning has been an ethos since Aristotle and Plato began sharing ideas), he is very vocal about its personal and professional benefits.

 

The logic behind LIP ties into the open-source culture of tech, and its thesis is to learn faster than privately learning. Swyx describes LIP as this:

 

“*You share what you learn, as you learn it. You Open Source your knowledge. You build a public record of your interests and progress, and along the way, you attract a community of mentors, peers, and supporters. They will help you learn faster than you ever could on your own. Your network could be vast, consisting of experts in every field, unconstrained by your org chart.*” - The Coding Career Handbook

 

By utilizing community based learning, and in turn, sharing what you learn with a community, you become part of a nearly infinite network of knowledge and opportunities.

###Sudoku Background


Sudoku is a game played on a 9x9 grid. The goal of the game is to fill all cells of the grid with digits from 1 to 9, so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids (also known as blocks) contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
More info at: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku)


###Sudoku Solution Validator
Write a function that accepts a Sudoku board, and returns true if it is a valid Sudoku solution, or false otherwise. The cells of the input Sudoku board may also contain 0's, which will represent empty cells. Boards containing one or more zeroes are considered to be invalid solutions.


###Examples
Valid board: 5 3 4|6 7 8|9 1 2 6 7 2|1 9 5|3 4 8 1 9 8|3 4 2|5 6 7 -----+-----+----- 8 5 9|7 6 1|4 2 3 4 2 6|8 5 3|7 9 1 7 1 3|9 2 4|8 5 6 -----+-----+----- 9 6 1|5 3 7|2 8 4 2 8 7|4 1 9|6 3 5 3 4 5|2 8 6|1 7 9Invalid board: This column has two 3's v This cell has a 0 > 0 3 4|6 7 8|9 1 2 6 7 2|1 9 5|3 4 8 1 9 8|3 4 2|5 6 7 -----+-----+----- 8 5 9|7 6 1|4 2 3 4 2 6|8 5 3|7 9 1 7 1 3|9 2 4|8 5 6 -----+-----+----- This box has /9 6 1|5 3 7|2 8 4 two 3's >| 2 8 3|4 1 9|6 3 5 < This row has two 3's \3 4 5|2 8 6|1 7 9
###Details

- All inputs are guaranteed to be 2D boards of size 9x9 with possible values in range 0-9. 
- Rows, columns and blocks (3x3 small squares) must contain each number from range 1-9 exactly once. 
- User solution must not modify input boards.
