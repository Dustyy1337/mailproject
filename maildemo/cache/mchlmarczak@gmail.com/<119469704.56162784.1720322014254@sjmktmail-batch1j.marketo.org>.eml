We recently announced a beta for AI features in Figma Design. In this email, we are sharing our approach to building AI [https://www.figma.com/ai/our-approach/?utm_source=figma&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tos&utm_content=inline_ai_features] features and what's next.

To improve these features, we plan to start training AI models to understand design concepts, patterns, file structure, and tooling in Figma. Learn more about how your team can manage AI and our other updates below.

MANAGING AI SETTINGS

Team admins can control how their teams use AI with two new settings for each
team they manage:

 * Whether your team can use AI features (on by default for Starter and
   Professional teams).
 * Whether content is shared for AI training (on by default for Starter and
   Professional teams).

AI features and content training are optional. Teams can use AI features, even if content training is turned off. Read how to access your AI settings here
[https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/17725942479127-Control-AI-features-and-content-training-settings?utm_source=figma&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tos&utm_content=inline_ai_settings].

The content training setting goes into effect on August 15th, 2024. If an admin turns off content training after that, new content and edits will not be used to train AI models.

NEW AI TERMS IN OUR POLICIES

The key updates to our Terms of Service [https://www.figma.com/legal/tos/?utm_source=figma&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tos&utm_content=inline_tos]
