ABOUT THE TEST
We're conducting the Hades II Technical Test prior to our Early Access launch to help us find and solve any technical issues we might have missed, to ensure anyone who tries Hades II in Early Access can have a smooth play experience from the start. The Technical Test contains much less content than what's in store for the Early Access launch, and may be available only to a relatively small subset of players who express interest in participating.

It's important to us to go into that launch with as few technical issues as possible, so that the focus can be on getting your feedback on the game itself. We appreciate your patience and support as we prepare, and we're very excited to share much more of our game with you soon!
