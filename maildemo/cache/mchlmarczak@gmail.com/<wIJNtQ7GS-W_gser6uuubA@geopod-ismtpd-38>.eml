Hey HypeSquaders,

Happy April! Did you catch our April Fool's joke this past weekend? Don't worry, we got you. Get yourself our April Fool's Sound Pack https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005617781 for Discord on desktop - available until April 10!

This month we’re bringing you some fresh new updates on Activities, Nitro drops, and upcoming events we’ll be attending!

Let's get into it, shall we?

Since we launched Activities last year, we’ve heard many of you ask, “when will Activities be available on mobile?” The wait is over. We’re happy to share that Activities are now available on Mobile & Tablet devices!

With new Mobile support on Discord Activities, you can enjoy the great outdoors while talking and playing with your friends on Discord, no matter where they are.

We’ve even launched our newest Activity, Gartic Phone, which you can also enjoy on your actual phone without having to juggle between your phone’s web browser and your Discord call.

In fact, you can enjoy nearly every Activity on mobile, with mobile support for Checkers in the Park and Poker Night following up soon to complete the selection. Read more about mobile support here https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4422142836759-Activities-Experiment.

If you’re a Nitro subscriber, you might have noticed we’ve begun to roll out an exciting, new and colorful perk. Soon, you’ll have the ability to customize the appearance and theme of your Discord app with Themes!

Right now, 16 unique Themes will be available for you to personalize your app (including a secret, hidden theme!). Choose from theme colors such as Chroma Glow, Citrus Sherbert, Midnight Blurple, and Retro Raincloud to name a few. With so many options, there’s a pretty good chance you’ll find something that matches your vibe.

As always, learn more about where you can access themes & how to set them up in our blog https://discord.com/blog/bring-your-vibe-to-discord-with-new-themes-in-nitro.

To our UK HypeSquad - we are excited to announce that Discord will be attending Insomnia Gaming Festival from the 7th to 10th of April! If you don't already have tickets, grab them here https://insomniagamingfestival.com/.

As an official events partner, we’ll be hanging out over on the official Insomnia server and we've got a bunch of fun Activities planned to help you get the most out of your experience. During the event, we are offering our latest Activities to everyone for free, so grab your friends and join us at the Insomnia Discord Server https://discord.gg/igfestuk.

Those attending the event will also have a chance to win free Nitro codes and you’ll be able to vote for the winner of the cosplay and dance competitions directly in the server. If you see Discord Staff at the event, make sure you say hi!

That’s all for now! We hope our latest product drops & upcoming events excite you as much as they excite us.

See you online,
