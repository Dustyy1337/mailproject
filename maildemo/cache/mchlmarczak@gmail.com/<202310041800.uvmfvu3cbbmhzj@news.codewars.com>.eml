How to Remain Resilient During Layoffs

Are you a technologist wondering how you can stand out from the crowd and retain your job during these tough economic times? If the answer is yes, then this article is for you!

Â 

US today reported that the tech industry added 1.3 million workers in the years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is an indication that there was a hiring boom. Â In 2020 the Tech industry experienced a season of layoffs and then recovered in 2021. There were so many job opportunities in 2021, so much so that people felt confident in resigning from their roles, and switching jobs to work in remote, flexible environments. Itâ€™s now known as the great resignation, or â€˜the great reshuffle.â€™

Â 

Sadly, due to recent uncertainty in the Tech industry, companies are once again forced into restructuring their teams and making layoffs. Â https://layoffs.fyi/ has been tracking the numbers. A number of reasons have been highlighted for these layoffs, the main ones being;

Â 


- Turbulent economic times â€“ Fears of a recession have seen consumers reduce expenditure, which has impacted revenue for many organizations.
Â  
- Change of strategy â€“ Organizations seem to be embracing the idea that the more lean they are, the more efficient they will be, e.g. the layoffs announced recently by Meta and Twitter.
Â  
- Product evolution and transformation â€“ Companies are becoming more focused on product profitability and are choosing to drop off products or projects that are not bearing much fruit, which is resulting in reorganization and restructuring.
Â  
- Over-hiring â€“ itâ€™s also been clear that most tech organizations anticipated growth after covid and therefore expanded. Unfortunately, business is not doing well for most and they have to downsize.

###[Find the middle element](https://www.codewars.com/kata/545a4c5a61aa4c6916000755?utm_source=newsletter)

As a part of this Kata, you need to create a function that when provided with a triplet, returns the index of the numerical element that lies between the other two elements.

The input to the function will be an array of three distinct numbers (Haskell: a tuple).

For example:

gimme([2, 3, 1]) => 0*2* is the number that fits between *1* and *3* and the index of *2* in the input array is *0*.

Another example (just to make sure it is clear):

gimme([5, 10, 14]) => 1*10* is the number that fits between *5* and *14* and the index of *10* in the input array is *1*.

###Checkerboard Resolution


In this kata we will be counting the the black squares on a special checkerboard. It is special because it has a resolution which determines how the black and white squares are laid out.

Good luck!
