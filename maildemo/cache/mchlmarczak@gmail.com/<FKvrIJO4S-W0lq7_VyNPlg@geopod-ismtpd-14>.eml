We just posted a new blog and shared an early glimpse of Project-R!

A first look at the future

We've just *put up our latest blog post* ( https://evercoreheroes.com/news/shaping-our-future-together ) in which we talk more about our transition towards Project-R and *share our thoughts* on the Co-Op topics we discussed with you, our players!

We asked you, the community, *4 Co-Op questions* regarding a variety of topics and did you deliver! In the blog post we'll *reflect on these topics* and ** give our high level thoughts *based on your feedback.*

Last but no least, we are *revealing a first very early glimpse* of some of the early changes we are working on with Project-R!

*Click below to read the blog* and check out the full screenshot!
