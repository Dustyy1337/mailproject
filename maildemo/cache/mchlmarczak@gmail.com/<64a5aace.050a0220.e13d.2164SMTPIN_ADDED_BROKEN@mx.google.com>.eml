Transfer Gallery items stored in Xiaomi Cloud Xiaomi Cloud Services Dear Xiaomi Cloud user, We're in the process of terminating cloud sync services for Gallery items. To avoid losing any of your data, we recommend following the instructions below to transfer or download your Gallery items as soon as possible. 1. Transfer items stored in the cloud to Google Photos First, make sure that your Gallery app is updated to the latest version (3.4.9.8). In the app, tap the dialog on the Start page or the notice at the top of the screen to start the transfer process, then follow the instructions. You can back up all your photos and videos to Google Photos. 2. Download items stored in the cloud to your device In your browser, visit i.mi.com, then tap the Gallery icon or select the dropdown menu next to your profile photo. Follow the instructions on the screen to download your items. Please note that you can only choose one of the above options. As of July 31, 2023, we will cease to offer transfer and download services for Gallery items, and any remaining Gallery items stored in Xiaomi Cloud will be permanently cleared.
