Start your community today! AutoMod, Admins, and product previews await you in Discordâ€™s latest update for community leaders. ðŸ’œ

Howdy, HypeSquad!

Since we saw you last, weâ€™ve been in the kitchen cookinâ€™ up some incredible new things. In factâ€¦

2022 is the year of communities and creators. Weâ€™re so excited to unveil new tools and resources to help you build better communities on Discord.

So if youâ€™re ready to get bust out the tools, strap in. Letâ€™s build a community.

Looking to start your first community or improve the one youâ€™ve got? Meet AutoMod, your new best friend in community moderation!

AutoMod brings an element of automation to help keep your community clean and lend a hand to your hard-working moderators.

So, how does it work?

Enable AutoMod inÂ Server Settings > Content ModerationÂ in servers with Community on https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server.

AutoMod will automatically detect and remove or flag messages containing harmful words or phrases before theyâ€™re posted.

Choose from readily available filters or customize your own by creating lists of words or phrases and the actions AutoMod will take when theyâ€™re found in your server.

Receive alerts from AutoMod when members try to use words from your lists and assign actions like Timeout from the alert itself.

AddÂ Wildcards (*)Â to your keywords to detect variations of words that partially match those on your lists (i.e., bake* â‡’ weÂ baked a cake,Â pressÂ â‡’ equal parts espresso and milk).

Take a deep dive into all things AutoMod in our blog https://discord.com/blog/automod-launch-automatic-community-moderation and Help Center article https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4421269296535-AutoMod-FAQ.

Your friendly AutoMod is raring to go on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and the web app. Donâ€™t delayâ€”employ your AutoMod today!

Admins are the leaders creating communities on Discord. From creators to builders, admins are the gardeners behind growing every incredible community.

Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re announcing two great resources to help Admins build incredible communities: Community Resources https://discord.com/community and the Discord Admin Community https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/5309276245271-Discord-Admin-Community-FAQ.

SoÂ bust out those toolbelts, intrepid new admins, and build the community of your dreams https://dis.gd/meet-admins!

But thatâ€™s not all. Our commitment to communities and creators runs deep.

In December, a small group of creators began testing Premium Memberships.

By working directly with creators, we can prioritize tools and features they need to best monetize their platforms, scale their businesses, and create engaging experiences for their communities.

Learn how Discord is expanding Premium Memberships https://discord.com/blog/update-tools-building-sustaining-communities-discord to even more communities this summer!

Weâ€™ve got so much more in store, HypeSquadders, but for now, we have to keep a lid on it.

Take it from us. From exciting new features like Text Chat in Voice Channels https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412085582359 to comprehensive resources, thereâ€™s never been a better time to turn your server into a Discord community.
