Celebrating the leap year
**************************

February 29th only occurs once every four years as we
synchronize with the Earth’s orbit around the sun. But how do we
know which years are leap years and which are not? What are the
rules and the logic behind this phenomenon? If you're curious to
find out, we have a challenge for you.

Leap Years by BattleRattle is a 7 kyu Kata that tests your
knowledge of leap year rules and logic. Leap Years is available
in 51 languages, from JavaScript to PHP.

Celebrate by solving this Kata
